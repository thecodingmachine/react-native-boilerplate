It\'s important for us to give you new reasons to try this boilerplate out!\\nWe would love to have new ideas to make it even more convenient!\\n\\nTo do so, we will post a changelog every major updates. Unlike the changelog in the releases tab, we\\nwill here provide more details and maybe some examples. \\n\\nIn this first post, we will present the current state of this boilerplate.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Light \ud83e\udeb6 Simple \ud83d\udc4c and Scalable \ud83d\udccf\\nThis boilerplate is the core of every react-native applications we develop at [TheCodingMachine](https://www.thecodingmachine.com/).\\nThis means that we are the first users! If an issue appear we are the first affected \ud83e\udd7a, that\'s why this project is actively maintained!\\n\\nThe main idea behind this boilerplate is to have just the necessary and well-known stuff to have a very\\n\\"*easy to use*\\" boilerplate for little and big real world apps.\\n\\nWe don\'t include components libraries, we don\'t depend on third-party libraries (like Firebase for example).\\nIt\'s just a good template project that is build on top of all the accumulated experience of our mobile teams.\\nIt also provides a solid architecture that facilitates separation of concerns between the UI, the state management\\nand the business logic.\\nLike that, everyone can add its own touch! \ud83d\udd8c\ufe0f\\n\\n\ud83d\udea8 Every decision about the technical stack are made regarding our preferences (every library has his\\npros and cons).\\n\\n## Easy to install \ud83d\ude0e\\n\\nInstallation has been facilitated since the v2.0.0, thanks to the use of the react-native-cli and \\n[custom template](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli/blob/master/docs/init.md#creating-custom-template).\\nTo run this boilerplate, the only commands you need are\\n\\n```\\nnpx react-native init --template @thecodingmachine/react-native-boilerplate\\nyarn start\\nyarn ios\\nyarn android\\n```\\n\\nThat\'s this simple! \ud83d\ude80\\n\\n## Typescript support \ud83d\udc99\\n\\nSince the v3.0.0, during the installation, you can choose to use typescript for your new app. \\nAll the boilerplate will then be translated in typescript.\\n\\n![Typescript init](./assets/typescript.png)\\n\\nThat\'s this simple! \ud83d\ude80\\n\\n## Solid libraries \ud83d\udd28\\n\\nAs I said before, main concerns are simplicity and scalability.\\nEach of the used libraries are well-known, tried and tested. \\n\\n### Well-know libraries\\n\\nFor the state management we use [**Redux**](https://redux.js.org/) (redux + redux toolkit + redux persist). \\nSome people like it, some people don\'t.\\nWe are really comfortable with this library, it\'s not so difficult to learn, and the implementation is well-known, \\nrecognized as a good choice and easy [to debug](/docs/UsingFlipper)! \\nThanks to this boilerplate and [redux-toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/), the state management is ready out of the box. \\nA complete example is even included. This way, you can easier understand how it works.\\nTo deal with the navigation, [**React Navigation**](https://reactnavigation.org/) is THE reference for screen navigation.\\nFor the internationalization we use [**I18next**](https://www.i18next.com/). Well-know library, really easy to use and \\nproviding nice hooks.\\n\\n### redux-toolkit-wrapper\\nThis project is a Redux-toolkit wrapper (yes... it\'s obvious \ud83d\ude05) used to write less code regarding classic CRUD operations.\\nRedux-toolkit provide a lot of abstraction for async operations, but we always have to create a `loading` and `error` \\nstate and associated reducers.\\nRedux-toolkit-wrapper abstract these async operations. For a classic *\\"fetch one user\\"* operation all you need is adding these files :\\n\\n```javascript title=\\"src/Store/User/FetchOne.js\\"\\nimport {\\n  buildAsyncState, buildAsyncReducers, buildAsyncActions,\\n} from \'@thecodingmachine/redux-toolkit-wrapper\'\\nimport fetchOneUserService from \'@/Services/User/FetchOne\'\\n\\nexport default {\\n  initialState: buildAsyncState(\'fetchOne\'),\\n  action: buildAsyncActions(\'user/fetchOne\', fetchOneUserService),\\n  reducers: buildAsyncReducers({\\n    errorKey: \'fetchOne.error\',\\n    loadingKey: \'fetchOne.loading\',\\n  }),\\n}\\n\\n```\\n\\n```javascript title=\\"src/Store/User/index.js\\"\\nconst sliceInitialState = {\\n  item: {},\\n}\\n\\nexport default buildSlice(\'user\', [FetchOne], sliceInitialState).reducer\\n```\\n\\nNext, you can use your state in your container like this:\\n\\n```javascript\\nimport React, { useEffect } from \'react\'\\nimport { useDispatch, useSelector } from \'react-redux\'\\nimport { View, ActivityIndicator, Text } from \'react-native\'\\nimport FetchOne from \'@/Store/User/FetchOne\'\\n\\nconst ExampleContainer = () => {\\n  const dispatch = useDispatch()\\n\\n  const user = useSelector(state => state.user.item)\\n  const fetchOneUserLoading = useSelector(state => state.user.fetchOne.loading)\\n  const fetchOneUserError = useSelector(state => state.user.fetchOne.error)\\n\\n  useEffect(() => {\\n    dispatch(FetchOne.action(id))\\n  }, [dispatch])\\n\\n  return (\\n    <View>\\n        {fetchOneUserLoading && <ActivityIndicator />}\\n        {fetchOneUserError ? (\\n          <Text style={Fonts.textRegular}>{fetchOneUserError.message}</Text>\\n        ) : (\\n          <Text style={Fonts.textRegular}>\\n            {t(\'example.helloUser\', { name: user.name })}\\n          </Text>\\n        )}\\n    </View>\\n  )\\n}\\n\\nexport default ExampleContainer\\n```\\n\\nThat\'s this simple! \ud83d\ude80\\n\\n:::info\\nFor more details about redux-toolkit-wrapper jump [**here**](/docs/ReduxStore)\\n:::\\n\\n## What\'s in the box? \ud83d\udce6\\n\\nStill hesitating ? Let\'s make a recap and see what this beautiful boilerplate can provide you:\\n- No headaches! \ud83e\udd12 Thanks to the **quick and easy install**, the\\n  **documentation** and of course the **included example**! (if you have all the installed\\n  [requirements](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html#installing-dependencies)\\n  of course)\\n- **Typescript** \ud83d\udc99 / **Javascript** \ud83d\udc9b ? Your project, your choice!\\n- Never again sailing on troubled waters with **React Navigation**: THE powerful library to handle navigation \ud83d\udcf1\\n- **Redux** (with redux-toolkit and redux-toolkit-wrapper \ud83d\ude09) : handling\\n  redux store has never been as easy as this!! \u26a1\\n- DarkMode or colorful app? Give your users the power to choose!\\n  **Multi-theming** and **darkMode** support \ud83c\udf17 (see [here](/docs/ThemesAndDarkMode))\\n- French kisses aren\'t translatable, but you can translate your app! **i18n friendly** \ud83c\udf10 (see [here](/docs/AddALangTranslation))\\n- You don\'t like bug hunt? Use **Flipper debugging** \ud83d\udc1b (see [here](/docs/UsingFlipper))\\n- Maintained by **passionate developers** \u269b\ufe0f\\n\\nJust Test It \ud83e\uddea !!\\n\\n## Installation plugins \u2699\ufe0f\\n\\nFreshly in the v3.0.0 we created an installation plugin system. Of course, the first plugin added is the typescript one. \ud83d\ude09\\nWe are now able to add local or npm plugins to our boilerplate in order to apply them during the installation. \\nThis way, we get the app template with the features we asked for.\\nIn other words, no unwelcome pieces of code will lay in your app architecture anymore.\\n\\nYou got it, it\'s only the beginning thinking about the many plugins we could create for this project. \ud83e\udd29\\nSo wait and see what could be the next plugins...\ud83d\udd53\ud83e\udd10\\n\\n## Why this boilerplate? \ud83d\udc19\\n\\nBefore starting this project, we looked for already existing boilerplates.\\nWe\'ve found some, but while many were (and are always) awesome, we did not find what we were\\nlooking for: a **light, scalable, and flexible boilerplate with a great separation of concerns**.\\n\\nOne of the most popular was\\n[Matt Mcnamee\'s React Native Starter Kit](https://github.com/mcnamee/react-native-starter-kit),\\nwhich unfortunately missed Redux middleware and React Navigation.\\n\\nDigging deeper in the react-native boilerplates (ignoring unmaintained projects),\\nmany popular boilerplates were too opinionated: they\\nincluded 3rd party services or very strong architecture choices\\nthat we were not comfortable with.\\nTo name a few:\\n- [Snowflake](https://github.com/bartonhammond/snowflake) ran with a Hapi Server running on Redhat OpenShift,\\n- [Apollo\'s StarterKit](https://github.com/sysgears/apollo-universal-starter-kit) is based on GraphQL using Apollo,\\n- [Meteor Boilerplate](https://github.com/spencercarli/react-native-meteor-boilerplate) is based on Meteor.\\n\\nFinally, some did not contain the architecture we were looking for (the separation of concerns),\\nfor example [re-start](https://github.com/react-everywhere/re-start).\\n\\nOne interesting exception was\\n[Ignite IR Boilerplate \\"Andross\\"](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite-andross), but after\\nconsideration we decided not to use it because of the large amount of\\nunnecessary code/components it provided out of the box.\\n\\nIn 2021, some react-native boilerplates have changed. Let\'s see what are\\nthe differences:\\n\\n<table>\\n    <thead>\\n    <tr>\\n        <th align=\\"left\\">Boilerplate</th>\\n        <th align=\\"left\\">Difference from our</th>\\n    </tr>\\n    </thead>\\n    <tbody>\\n    <tr>\\n        <td align=\\"left\\">mcnamee/react-native-starter-kit</td>\\n        <td align=\\"left\\">\\n            <ul>\\n                <li>No React Navigation (react-native-router-flux instead),</li>\\n                <li>No Typescript support,</li>\\n                <li>Don\'t use the react-native-cli to init</li>\\n            </ul>\\n        </td>\\n    </tr>\\n    <tr>\\n        <td align=\\"left\\">bartonhammond/snowflake</td>\\n        <td align=\\"left\\">Seems not maintained anymore (last release was in 2017) \ud83d\udca4</td>\\n    </tr>\\n    <tr>\\n        <td align=\\"left\\">sysgears/apollo-universal-starter-kit</td>\\n        <td align=\\"left\\">\\n            <ul>\\n                <li>Is based on GraphQL using Apollo,</li>\\n                <li>Don\'t use the react-native-cli to init</li>\\n            </ul>\\n        </td>\\n    </tr>\\n    <tr>\\n        <td align=\\"left\\">spencercarli/react-native-meteor-boilerplate</td>\\n        <td align=\\"left\\">Seems not maintained (no release, last commit was in 2018) \ud83d\udca4</td>\\n    </tr>\\n    <tr>\\n        <td align=\\"left\\">react-everywhere/re-start</td>\\n        <td align=\\"left\\">Seems not maintained (last release was in 2017) \ud83d\udca4</td>\\n    </tr>\\n    <tr>\\n        <td align=\\"left\\">infinitered/ignite</td>\\n        <td align=\\"left\\">\\n            <ul>\\n                <li>Specific folders for ignite-cli and boilerplate items,</li>\\n                <li>MobX instead of Redux,</li>\\n                <li>Expo ready,</li>\\n                <li>Reactotron (ignite product) ready,</li>\\n                <li>Typescript only</li>\\n            </ul>\\n        </td>\\n    </tr>\\n    </tbody>\\n</table>\\n\\nSo there is no reason to hesitate : come \ud83e\uddf2, test \ud83e\uddea and leave a star \u2b50\\n\\nThanks for reading, See you for the next release. \ud83c\udff7\ufe0f"}]}')}}]);
