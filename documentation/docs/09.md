# Competitor Analysis

As a novel product, Stable Jack is positioned between yield products and derivatives platforms.

**Compared to an average yield product, Stable Jack offers a better user experience and more options, summarized as follows:**

* While an average yield product only allows yield and points trading, Stable Jack also enables volatility trading.
* At an average yield product, Yield Token holders give up their principal for potential returns. However, at Stable Jack, users can maintain their principal while benefiting from leveraged yield returns.
* An average yield product only supports pairs with maturity dates, whereas, on Stable Jack, most pairs do not have a maturity date.
* Stable Jack allows third-party protocols like market makers, hedge funds, and fund managers to create Curated Pairs accessible to retail users—something not possible on an average yield product.
* Stable Jack doesn’t depend on the AMM model but a pool model, this prevent slippage and impermanent loss for users.

**Stable Jack’s Volatility Token is set to revolutionize the derivatives market. Stable Jack offers several advantages over these protocols:**

* Traders on an average derivatives protocol must always manage the risk of liquidation, while Volatility Token holders at Stable Jack face no liquidation risk.
* An average derivatives protocol requires traders to pay significant funding fees, which forces them into short-term positions. In contrast, Stable Jack has no funding fees, allowing users to maintain leveraged long exposure for extended periods.
* Leverage contracts at an average derivatives protocol are not tokenized, unlike Volatility Tokens at Stable Jack, which provide better capital efficiency.
* Volatility Tokens are the most cost-effective way to achieve long exposure, as traders are not required to pay funding fees.
