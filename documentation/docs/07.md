# Introduction to Points Token (PT)

### What is the Points Token?&#x20;

Points Token (PT) is a token that enables investors to farm the points/airdrop of their favorite program with leverage. In addition to farming the airdrop with leverage, Points Token offers principal protection.

The main features of Points Token can be summarized as:

* Points Tokens enable **leveraged airdrop farming.**
* Points Tokens are **principal protected assets** so they are the safest way to farm the airdrops.
* Points Tokens **can be used as collateral**, enabling more leverage.
* Points Token holders can **maintain a long position** on the collateral asset while also farming the airdrop with leverage.

**Note:** Every collateral asset will have a unique Points Token.

**Note:** Point Tokens are subject to maturity dates that are based on the partner protocol’s points distribution program.
