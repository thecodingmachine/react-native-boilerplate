# Introduction to Yield Token (YT)

### What is the Yield Token?

Yield Token (YT) is a yield-bearing asset that accrues the yield from the collateral asset.

**The main features of the Yield Token can be summarized as:**

* The Yield Token offers both **fixed and variable yield** options depending on the collateral.
* The Yield Token is a yield-bearing asset expected to generate **above-market returns.**
* It can be used as collateral in DeFi protocols, enabling the possibility of **looping the yield.**
* Principal protection - Unlike other yield products, Yield Token holders retain their principal while earning yield.

**Note:** Every collateral asset will have a unique Yield Token.

**Note:** For "yield trade" products, Yield Tokens are subject to cycle rollover, which defines the fixed yield for a certain period. The timeline for the fixed yield is determined with the partner protocol and it will be updated every cycle rollover.
